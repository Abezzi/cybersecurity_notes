# Introduction to cybersecurity

problem: 1 attack every 39s
solution: security analyst to protect the organization

## 1.1

- cybersecurity: is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

cybersecurity has three levels of protection: 
 
- Personal (identity, data, computing devices) 
- Organizational (reputation, data and customers)
- Government (national security, economic stability, safety and wellbeing of citizens)

Offline identity: real-life persona (real name, age, address)
Online identity: you online (username and how you present yourself online)

## 1.2 Organizational data

- **traditional data**: details relating buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions.
- **intellectual property**: such as patents, trademark and new product plans, which allow an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitios. this information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.
- **Financial data**: such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company.

**internet of things (IoT) and big data**: IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. all of these things are connected to the internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it's no surprise that the emerge of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creaing a new area of intereset in technology and business called 'Big Data'.

## the cube (Jhon McCumber 1991)

helps organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

1. the foundational principles for protecting information systems.
2. the protection of information in each of its possible states.
3. the security measures used to protect data.

## elements of each dimension:

### Foundational principles for protecting information
- **confidentiality** is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and process. Methods to ensure confidentiallity include data encryption, indentity proofing. and two factor authentication.
- **integrity**: ensures that system information processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. One way to ensure integrity is to use a hash function or checksum.
- **availability**: means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs, keeping operating systems and software up to date, and creating backups

### The protection of information in each state
- **Processing** refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database record (data in process)
- **Storage** refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, solid state drive or USB drive (data at rest)
- **Transmission** refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit)

### The security measures used to protect data
- **Awareness, training and education** are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure that users are knowledgable about potential security threat and the actions they can take to protect information systems.
- **Technology** refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.
- **Policy and procedure** refers to the administrative controls that provive a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.
